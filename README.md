## ML-Final-Project
Wine classification with supervised and unsupervised models.

Understanding the chemical composition of wine has profound implications for both
quality control and the study of viticulture. In this project, I investigate whether the class of
a wine—a botanical grouping corresponding to three different grape cultivars—can be
reliably predicted from 13 routinely measured chemical attributes. I further examine
whether unsupervised clustering uncovers the same natural divisions among samples without
any prior labeling.
